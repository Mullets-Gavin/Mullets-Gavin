Dice Software is all of my modules & open source code that I use in Mullet Mafia Dev games. Each module is designed to work with [Playing Cards](https://github.com/Mullets-Gavin), my module library. Dice was chosen as the prefix for this code for the thematic design that can be related to both Playing Cards & Mullet Mafia Dev. Code will be maintained.
