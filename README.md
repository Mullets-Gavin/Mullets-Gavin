Hi there üëã! My name is Gavin, and I go by Mullets. I have always had a passion for programming since 2013 when I first started using the game platform Roblox. Subsequently, I have been learning and teaching myself to program by pushing the limits of my knowledge. This can be seen with the Roblox game I programmed & published titled ‚ÄúCaptive‚Äù, holding a consistent 500+ daily concurrent player base. My work has been seen by millions, amassing 20m+ plays at the time of writing.

My professional experience consists of working with teams and other developers on the platform under my studio Mullet Mafia Dev & Red Riptide which I co-founded. I am fluent in Lua, Python, & Julia with proficiency in using Roblox Studio, Paint.NET, and human-computer interaction studies.

Outside of my work, I like to stream on Twitch & connect with the Roblox community via the Roblox Developer Forum. In the past, I have volunteered on the forum directly under Roblox for their forum‚Äôs Post Approval team, which aims to help users who are starting their Roblox careers to receive the help and knowledge needed to create insightful posts and to learn new skills.
